/* This is the function that runs the 1905 Abstraction Layer (AL) state machine.
*
*  In order to start the AL services this is what you have to do from your
*  platform specific code:
*
*    1. Create a thread
*    2. Make that thread execute this function
*
*  This function takes the following arguments:
*
*    - 'al_mac_address': a six bytes array containing the AL MAC address of the
*      local host.
*    - 'map_whole_network_flag': If set to '1', the AL entity will map the whole
*      network (instead of just its direct neighbors). This takes more memory
*      and generates much more packets on the network, however the TR069
*      datamodel of this particular node will contain all the information
*      defined in the standard.
*      I would personally *only* set this flag to '1' in *one* of the network
*      nodes.
*    - 'registrar_interface' is the name of the local interface (ex: "wlan0")
*      that will act as a registrar in the 1905 network.
*      Note that *only one registrar* should be present in the 1905 network,
*      thus this parameter should:
*        a) Be set to NULL in all those ALs that are not registrars.
*        b) Be set to the name of a local 802.11 interface (ex: "wlan0") in the
*           AL that will act as a registrar.
*
*  It returns when:
*
*    - Something went terribly wrong (maybe at initiallization time or maybe
*      later, while doing its bussiness). It that case it returns an error code
*      which is always bigger than '0':
*
*        AL_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY:
*          A call to "PLATFORM_MALLOC()" failed, meaning there is no more memory
*          available in the system.
*
*        AL_ERROR_INVALID_ARGUMENTS:
*          The provided 'al_mac_address' is not valid.
*
*        AL_ERROR_NO_INTERFACES:
*          A call to "PLATFORM_GET_LIST_OF_1905_INTERFACES()" returned an empty
*          list, meaning there is nothing for the 1905 AL entity to do.
*
*        AL_ERROR_INTERFACE_ERROR:
*          A call to "PLATFORM_GET_LIST_OF_1905_INTERFACES() returned an error
*          or some other interface related problem.
*
*        AL_ERROR_OS:
*          One of the OS-related PLATFORM_* functions returned an error (these
*          are functions use to create queues, start timers, etc...)
*
*        AL_ERROR_PROTOCOL_EXTENSION;
*          Error registering, at least, one protocol extension.
*
*    - The HLE requested the AL service to stop. In this case it will return '0'
