/* The following preprocessor macros must be defined to a platform-dependent
*  value:
*
*    __BYTE_ORDER__            --------> This indicates your CPU endianness.
*                                        It is predefined by gcc(if it is newer than v4.6)
*                                        If it is not predefined, you should set to
*                                        __ORDER_LITTLE_ENDIAN__ or __ORDER_BIG_ENDIAN__
*
*    MAX_NETWORK_SEGMENT_SIZE  --------> This is the maximum packet size that
*                                        is allowed in your platform. It is
*                                        used to 'fragment' CMDUs.  Note that
*                                        even if your platform supports packets
*                                        bigger than 1500 bytes, this macro
*                                        must never be bigger than that.  This
*                                        macro is only present in this file for
*                                        those special cases where, for some
*                                        platform related reason, packets must
*                                        be smaller than 1500.
*
*
*  In the next few lines we are just going to check that these are defined,
*  nothing else.
*  In order to actually define them use the "root" Makefile where these MACROS
*  are sent to the compiler using the "-D flag" (open the "root" Makefile and
*   search for "CCFLAGS" to understand how to do this)
